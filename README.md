# Colemak DH ANSI MacOS

The keylayout bundles in the [official ColemakDH mod MacOS distribution](https://github.com/ColemakMods/mod-dh/tree/master/macOS)
aren't really mapping correctly the multilingual aspect of the [original Colemak](https://colemak.com/Mac).
This repo contains keylayouts generated from a series of search and replaces to
apply the DH mod to the original Colemak.

## TODO

- [ ] Test to see if this is correct.
- [ ] Test to see if this is actually better than the official ones (I don't have a MacOS right now). 
- [ ] Do for other dh mods.
- [ ] Send a PR for the official ColemakDH mod if valuable.
